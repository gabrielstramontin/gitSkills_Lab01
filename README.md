Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- You practiced the content creating a Branch, a Commit and a Pull Request. Also, by the end, you merged a Pull Request.
- Congrats, you made your first contribution at GitHub! :tada:

### What's next?
- Try to make your custom profile README

- Main Steps:
1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
